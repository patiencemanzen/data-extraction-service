This indicates that the document and submitted data do not appear to be authentic.\n\n**Verification Process with Facial Data:**\n\nIf a face image was provided, we could implement the following steps:\n\n1. **Face Detection:** Use a facial recognition API to detect the face in the provided image.\n2. **Facial Feature Extraction:** Extract key features from the detected face, such as distance between eyes, nose width, etc.\n3. **Comparison:** Compare the extracted features with those extracted from a reference image (if available).\n4. **Matching:** If the features match within a predefined threshold, then the face image would be deemed a match.\n5. **Verification:** The face matching result could be used to verify the identity of the individual in conjunction with other document data.\n\n**Note:** This is a simplified example.  In a real-world scenario, facial recognition systems would typically use more sophisticated techniques for feature extraction and matching. \n",
